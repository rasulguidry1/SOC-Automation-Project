# Overview
This hands-on cybersecurity project simulates a real-world Security Operations (SOC) environment. It focuses on alert automation, SIEM integration, and incident response workflows to strengthen detection and response efficiency.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to: 

• Automate repetitve SOC analyst tasks using Python and SOAR principles

• Integrate logs into a SIEM (e.g., Micrsoft Sentinel, Splunk)

• Detect and respond to simulated attacks in a controlled lab environment
